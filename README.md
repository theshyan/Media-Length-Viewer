# Media-Length-Viewer
A Python tool to view and sum durations of videos (.mp4, .mkv) and music (.mp3), with terminal &amp; simple GUI support.

**Feel free to take it further and enhance it!**

# About
This is the first project Iâ€™m sharing here, and I wanted it to be something fun. a tool that I've always used for myself. 

Itâ€™s a simple script that scans through my movie collection and tells me which movie is from which "year" and what its "duration" is.

Iâ€™ve also added a GUI to make things a bit more challenging for myself. The music section is set up the same way, but Iâ€™ll leave the task of creating a GUI for music to you. 

# How to run
1. **clone the project**
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   py main.py
   ```
4. **Enter your movie files path:**
   ```bash
   Enter the directory path:
   (like: f:\Movies)
   > F:\Movies
   ```
   
**Example output**
| No. | Movie Title            | Year | Duration  |
|-----|------------------------|------|-----------|
| 16  | Kill Bill Vol 2        | 2004 | 02:16:57  |
| 17  | A Taxi Driver          | 2017 | 02:17:13  |
| 18  | Decision to Leave      | 2022 | 02:18:28  |
| 19  | Catch Me If You Can    | 2002 | 02:20:43  |

If you want to add more features, such as a more advanced GUI or extra media file formats, your contributions are more than welcome!
Thanks for checking out this project, and I hope it helps you with managing your movie and music collection! ;)

Happy coding! ðŸš€
